something about WSYNC (wait for horizontal sync):
    wsync freezes the 6502 until scan line reaches right edge of playfield (from de re atari)
    could this be used to ensure that the line of players are fully drawn before moving to the next scan line?

things to test:
    during player_missile.h/write_sprite, set WSYNC register
